Even Sooner:
* Make sure the map fits in the frame.
* Show how large each Q is in the legend.

Soon:
* Only use fast nodes (200 KBps+?)

Later:
* There should be a stronger score for how low a country is rated, leading to a total diversity score.
	* Should include: unique (AS, families), bandwith, consensus weight
* Historical Data
