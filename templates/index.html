<h1>About</h1>
<p>
The more diverse the Tor network, the harder it is to track a connection.
Currently there are a large number of nodes in North America and Europe.
As of 2014, <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/nsa-documents-attacks-on-vpn-ssl-tls-ssh-tor-a-1010525.html">there is not enough coverage of the Tor network to perform circuit analysis</a>.
Even though it's good enough, the Five Eyes only get more eyes.
Diversity needs to spread even more, primarily in Asia, South America, Africa, and Oceania.
</p>

<p>
This software is probably not perfect.
It is a good reference but is not suitable for human judgement.
Some of these countries do not run tor nodes for good reasons, weather it is political or technological.
